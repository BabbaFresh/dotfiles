Walialu Linux dotfiles
======================

These are my (Arch-)Linux dot(/config)-files.

I am currently sporting Gnome3 with [Numix][numixlink], [Conky][conkylink] and plank,
so the config files might be only of interest to you if you are
sporting a similar setup (or plan to be as as cool as I am ;-)

[numixlink]: http://numixproject.org/ "Numix is a modern and stylish way to give your desktop a warm and jazzy feel."
[conkylink]: http://conky.sourceforge.net/ "Conky is a free, light-weight system monitor for X, that displays any information on your desktop. Conky is licensed under the GPL and runs on Linux and BSD."
[planklink]: http://wiki.go-docky.com/index.php?title=Plank:Introduction "Plank is meant to be the simplest dock on the planet."
